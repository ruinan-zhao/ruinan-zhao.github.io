Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the University of California, Riverside.  


My research interests include labor economics, the economics of education, applied microeconomics, and public policy. My current research papers focus on using large-scale administrative data on students and educators to study student achievement and long-run academic outcomes.  

I also work as a Research Assistant at the [Presley Center of Crime & Justice Studies](https://presleycenter.ucr.edu/).  

I will be on the job market in **2025â€“2026**.
