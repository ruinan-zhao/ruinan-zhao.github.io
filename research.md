**How Does a Four-Day School Week Affect High School Students? Evidence from Colorado** (with Meng Song)  

This paper studies the effects of four-day school weeks (4DSW) on high school outcomes using comprehensive administrative data from Colorado, the state with the highest prevalence of 4DSW adoption. The dataset covers nearly two decades of entry cohorts and more than one million unique student records, allowing the first large-scale causal analysis of the policy in Colorado. Exploiting staggered adoption across districts in a difference-in-differences design, we find that 4DSW modestly improve standardized test scores, reduce dropout, and increase both on-time and overall graduation. The effects are particularly strong for students first exposed in middle school, highlighting the importance of timing and adjustment. At the same time, heterogeneous impacts show that English Learners and homeless students benefit less, raising equity concerns. Teacher retention improves under the 4DSW, but additional mechanisms likely contribute to the gains. Together, these findings challenge the common view that 4DSW harm student learning and provide timely evidence for districts and states considering alternative school schedules.
